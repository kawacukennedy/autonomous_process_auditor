    "overview": "APA is a multi-agent, event-driven system centered on IBM watsonx Orchestrate. Agents ingest workflow events and logs from connected systems, analyze them using foundation models (watsonx.ai Granite models where needed), identify inefficiencies or rule violations, propose fixes, and autonomously execute or schedule remediation actions. A lightweight backend exposes REST APIs, persists audit data and configurations, and serves the frontend dashboard. Cloudant/NoSQL stores event logs and audit traces. The entire orchestration and user-facing action execution surface uses Orchestrate for no/low-code agents and skill integrations, while the backend provides adapters, webhooks, and governance controls.",

  "winning_criteria_checklist": [
    "Novelty: APA shifts the paradigm from ad-hoc automation to continuous autonomous governance — instead of only automating tasks, it audits and remediates workflows end-to-end. This original angle (autonomous auditing + automated remediation orchestration) differentiates it from typical Assistants or single-use automations.",
    "Technical Complexity: The most complex component is the multi-agent orchestration combining Orchestrate skills, watsonx.ai model inference for pattern detection and remediation plan generation, and safe executor flows (policy guardrails + cross-app tool calls). Demonstrating end-to-end agent collaboration, decision tracing, and safe execution will impress judges technically.",
    "Polish/UX: The best UX feature is the 'Findings & Recommendations' experience — clear timelines, swimlane visualizations of process bottlenecks, a single-click 'propose vs apply' control, and exportable executive reports. Combined with realtime live feed and agent trace replay, this provides a polished demo-ready experience.",
    "Impact: APA can save organizations time and money by reducing approval delays, cutting repetitive manual work, and catching compliance drift early. It turns monitoring into action — a measurable ROI pitch (minutes saved per approval * approvals/month * salary cost) will strongly persuade judges about business impact."
